<div class = "abtustext">
    <p class = "abtusp">Most music apps create playlists solely based on users' moods, but they fail to capture their daily experiences. People often seek music that reflects their entire day, not just their emotions in a single . That's why we created Mood Musicâ€”a web app that generates a playlist based on three words the user selects to describe their day.</p>
